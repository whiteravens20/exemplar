## 🤝 Code of Conduct

We're committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone! 🌈

Please read our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details on our community standards and how we expect everyone to behave.

**TL;DR:** Be kind, be respectful, be awesome! ❤️

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? No worries - it happens! 🪲 Here's how to report it effectively:

### Before You Submit

1. 🔍 **Search existing issues** - Someone might have already reported it
2. 📖 **Check the docs** - Make sure it's actually a bug and not expected behavior
3. 🆕 **Use the latest version** - The bug might already be fixed in v2.0.0+

### Creating a Bug Report

When you're ready to report, create a new issue and include:

✅ **Clear title** - Something like "Rate limiter not working in DMs"  
✅ **Detailed description** - What went wrong?  
✅ **Reproduction steps** - How can we see the bug ourselves?  
✅ **Expected behavior** - What should have happened?  
✅ **Actual behavior** - What actually happened?  
✅ **Environment info**:
   - Node.js version (should be 22+)
   - Discord.js version
   - Operating System
✅ **Logs** - Attach relevant logs from `logs/combined.log` or `logs/error.log`  
✅ **Screenshots** - If applicable! 📸

**Pro tip:** The more details you provide, the faster we can fix it! ⚡

## 💡 Suggesting Features

Have an awesome idea? We'd love to hear it! 🌟

### Before You Suggest

1. 🔍 Check if someone already suggested it
2. 💭 Think about how it fits with the project's goals (DM-only bot, n8n integration, coding mode, etc.)
3. 🤔 Consider if it's something many users would benefit from

### Creating a Feature Request

Create a new issue or discussion with `[FEATURE]` in the title and include:

✨ **What** - What feature do you want?  
❓ **Why** - Why would it be useful?  
💡 **How** - Any ideas on implementation?  
📊 **Use cases** - Real-world scenarios where this helps  
🎨 **Examples** - Links to similar features elsewhere (if any)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to code? Awesome! Let's get you set up. 🎮

### Prerequisites

- 📦 Node.js 22+ (LTS) - **Required as of v2.0.0!**
- 📦 npm 10+ or yarn
- 🤖 Discord Bot Token ([Get one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- 🔄 n8n instance (for testing workflows)
- ☕ Your favorite beverage

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub 🍴
# Click the "Fork" button on the repo page

# 2. Clone YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/exemplar.git
cd exemplar

# 3. Add upstream remote (to sync with main repo)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whiteravens20/exemplar.git

# 4. Install dependencies 📦
npm install

# 5. Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your test bot token and n8n details

# 6. Deploy slash commands to your test server
npm run deploy-commands

# 7. Start in development mode with auto-reload 🔥
npm run dev
```

### 🎯 Important: Project Architecture (v2.0.0+)

Before you start coding, understand these key architectural decisions:

🔒 **DM-Only Mode** - The bot exclusively operates in Direct Messages (privacy-first design)  
💻 **Dual AI Modes** - `!code` prefix routes to specialized coding LLM, default is chat mode  
🚦 **Rate Limiting** - Built-in protection: 5 messages/minute per user  
✂️ **Smart Message Splitting** - Automatically handles Discord's 2000 character limit  
🔄 **n8n Integration** - All AI responses go through n8n workflows  
📦 **Node.js 22+** - We use the latest LTS features!

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 🌿 Branching Strategy

`dev` is the active development branch and the target for every pull request.
`main` holds released code and is updated only by a release PR from `dev`.

```bash
# Always start from an up-to-date dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev

# Create a feature branch with a descriptive name
git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/annoying-bug
```

### 🎨 Making Changes

1. 💡 **Make your changes** - Code away!
2. 🧪 **Test locally** - Make sure it works
3. 📝 **Update docs** - If needed
4. ✅ **Commit often** - Small, atomic commits are your friend!

### 📦 Committing Changes

We use **conventional commits** - they help generate changelogs automatically! 🎉

**Format:** `type: brief description`

**Types:**
- ✨ `feat` - New feature (e.g., `feat: add user statistics command`)
- 🐛 `fix` - Bug fix (e.g., `fix: resolve rate limiter memory leak`)
- 📚 `docs` - Documentation only (e.g., `docs: update contributing guide`)
- ♻️ `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- ✅ `test` - Adding or updating tests
- ⚡ `perf` - Performance improvement
- 🔧 `chore` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: update dependencies`)
- 🔒 `security` - Security improvements

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for voice channel monitoring"
git commit -m "fix: correct DM detection logic"
git commit -m "docs: add examples for coding mode usage"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify error handler code"
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

Let's keep the code clean and consistent! ✨

### 🏗️ File Structure

```typescript
// 1. Imports (grouped logically)
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';
import axios from 'axios';

// 2. Local imports
import logger from '../utils/logger.js';
import configManager from '../config/config.js';

// 3. Constants
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;

// 4. Main code
async function doSomething(): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation here
}

// 5. Exports
export { doSomething };
export default doSomething;
```

### 🏷️ Naming Conventions

- 🐫 `camelCase` for variables and functions: `userId`, `handleMessage()`
- 🐫 `PascalCase` for classes: `MessageHandler`, `RateLimiter`
- 🔤 `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants: `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`, `API_TIMEOUT`
- 📝 Use descriptive names: `userMessage` not `msg`, `retryCount` not `x`

**Examples:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good
const messageContent = interaction.content;
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;
class ErrorHandler { }

// ❌ Avoid
const mc = interaction.content;
const max = 3;
class errorhandler { }
```

### 📊 Logging

We use Winston for logging - it's your best friend for debugging! 🔍

```typescript
import logger from '../utils/logger.js';

// 📘 Info - Normal operations
logger.info('Message received from user', { 
  userId: message.author.id,
  mode: isCodeMode ? 'code' : 'chat' 
});

// ⚠️ Warning - Something unexpected but not broken
logger.warn('Rate limit approaching', { 
  userId: user.id, 
  messageCount: count 
});

// 🚨 Error - Something went wrong
logger.error('Failed to send to n8n', { 
  error: (error as Error).message,
  url: webhookUrl
});
```

**Pro tip:** Always include context! It makes debugging so much easier. 🎯

### 🛡️ Error Handling

Always handle errors gracefully - users should never see raw error stacks! 🙈

```typescript
try {
  await riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  // Log the full error for debugging
  logger.error('Operation failed', { 
    error: (error as Error).message,
    context: { userId, action }
  });
  
  // Show user-friendly message
  await interaction.reply({
    content: '❌ Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later.',
    ephemeral: true
  });
}
```

### 💬 Comments

Write comments that explain **WHY**, not **WHAT** - the code should be self-explanatory! 💡

```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Explains what (obvious from code)
// Check if user is admin
if (member.permissions.has('ADMINISTRATOR')) {

// ✅ Good - Explains why (business logic)
// Only admins can bypass rate limiting for urgent announcements
if (member.permissions.has('ADMINISTRATOR')) {

// ✅ Good - Complex logic explanation
// Use exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s for retries
// This prevents overwhelming the n8n server during outages
const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000;
```

## 🔨 Creating New Features

### 🎮 Adding a Slash Command

Want to add a new slash command? Here's the template! 🚀

```typescript
// src/slashcommands/mycommand.ts
import { SlashCommandBuilder, type ChatInputCommandInteraction } from 'discord.js';
import logger from '../utils/logger.js';
import type { SlashCommand } from '../types/discord.js';

const command: SlashCommand = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('mycommand')
    .setDescription('🎉 Description of your awesome command')
    .addStringOption(option =>
      option.setName('text')
        .setDescription('Some helpful text input')
        .setRequired(true)
    )
    .addIntegerOption(option =>
      option.setName('amount')
        .setDescription('An optional number')
        .setRequired(false)
    ),
  
  async execute(interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Get options
      const text = interaction.options.getString('text');
      const amount = interaction.options.getInteger('amount') ?? 1;
      
      // Log the command usage
      logger.info('Command executed', {
        command: 'mycommand',
        userId: interaction.user.id,
        guildId: interaction.guild?.id
      });
      
      // Do something awesome
      const result = await doSomethingCool(text, amount);
      
      // Reply to user
      await interaction.reply({
        content: `✨ ${result}`,
        ephemeral: false // Set to true for private replies
      });
      
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Command execution failed', {
        command: 'mycommand',
        error: (error as Error).message,
      });
      
      await interaction.reply({
        content: '❌ Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again.',
        ephemeral: true
      });
    }
  }
};

export default command;
```

**Don't forget:** Run `npm run deploy-commands` after adding new commands! 🔄

### 🎯 Adding an Event Handler

Events are what make the bot react to Discord actions! ⚡

```typescript
// src/events/myevent.ts
import { Events, type Message } from 'discord.js';
import logger from '../utils/logger.js';
import type { BotEvent } from '../types/discord.js';

const event: BotEvent = {
  name: Events.MessageCreate, // or Events.GuildMemberAdd, etc.
  once: false, // Set to true for events that should only fire once
  
  async execute(message: Message): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // Your event handling logic here
      logger.info('Event triggered', {
        event: 'MessageCreate',
        userId: message.author.id
      });
      
      // Do something with the event
      await handleMessage(message);
      
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Event handler error', {
        event: 'MessageCreate',
        error: (error as Error).message
      });
    }
  }
};

export default event;
```

### 🔧 Adding a Utility Function

Creating a reusable utility? Put it in `/src/utils/`! 🛠️

```typescript
// src/utils/my-helper.ts
import logger from './logger.js';

/**
 * 📝 Description of what this utility does
 * @param input - What this parameter is for
 * @param options - Optional configuration
 * @returns What this returns
 */
async function myHelper(input: string, options: Record<string, unknown> = {}): Promise<string> {
  try {
    // Your helper logic
    const result = processInput(input, options);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Helper function error', { error: (error as Error).message });
    throw error; // Re-throw for caller to handle
  }
}

export { myHelper };
export default myHelper;
```

## ✅ Testing Your Changes

Testing is super important! 🧪 Here's how to make sure your code works:

### 🏃 Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Type check your code
npm run typecheck

# 2. Deploy commands (if you added/modified slash commands)
npm run deploy-commands

# 3. Build the project
npm run build

# 4. Start the bot in dev mode
npm run dev

# 5. Test in Discord!
# - Create a test server
# - Add your bot
# - Try all the features you changed
# - Test error cases too!
```

### 🎯 Testing Checklist

Before submitting your PR, make sure you've tested:

- ✅ **Happy path** - Does it work when everything goes right?
- ✅ **Error handling** - What happens when things go wrong?
- ✅ **Edge cases** - Empty inputs? Very long inputs? Special characters?
- ✅ **Rate limiting** - Does it respect the 5 messages/minute limit?
- ✅ **DM-only mode** - Does it work in DMs? Does it ignore guild messages?
- ✅ **Coding mode** - If relevant, test with `!code` prefix
- ✅ **Logs** - Check that appropriate logs are generated

### 🧪 Automated Tests

We use Vitest for testing critical utilities:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npx vitest --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npx vitest --coverage
```

If you're adding new utility functions (especially in `/src/utils/`), please add tests! 🎯

```typescript
// tests/my-helper.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { myHelper } from '../src/utils/my-helper.js';

describe('myHelper', () => {
  it('should handle valid input', async () => {
    const result = await myHelper('test input');
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
  
  it('should throw error on invalid input', async () => {
    await expect(myHelper('')).rejects.toThrow();
  });
});
```

## 📚 Documentation

Good documentation is just as important as good code! 📖

### 📝 When to Update Documentation

Update the docs when you:

- ✨ Add a new feature → Update `README.md` and relevant guides
- 🐛 Fix a bug → Make sure the PR title describes it (release notes are generated from PR titles)
- 🔧 Change configuration → Update `SETUP.md` and `.env.example`
- 🏗️ Modify project structure → Update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

Security is serious business! 🛡️ Here's how to keep the project safe:

### 🚫 Never Commit Secrets

**NEVER EVER** commit these to the repository:

- 🔑 Discord bot tokens
- 🔐 API keys
- 🗝️ Webhook URLs
- 💾 Database credentials
- 🔒 Any sensitive data

**Use `.env` for secrets!** The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` for a reason. ☝️

### ✅ Security Checklist

- [ ] 🔍 Review your changes for exposed secrets before committing
- [ ] 🛡️ Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] 🔐 Use permission checks for sensitive operations
- [ ] 📊 Log security-relevant events
- [ ] ⚡ Keep dependencies up to date
- [ ] 🔒 Use environment variables for configuration

### 🔧 Security Commands

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically (when possible)
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update dependencies
npm update
```

**Pro tip:** Dependabot is configured to automatically create PRs for security updates! 🤖

### 🚨 Found a Security Issue?

If you discover a security vulnerability, **DO NOT** open a public issue! 

Instead:
1. 📧 Email the maintainers privately
2. 🔒 Include details and reproduction steps
3. ⏰ Give us reasonable time to fix it
4. 🎉 We'll credit you in the fix announcement (if you want)

**See our [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for full details on responsible disclosure.**

## ⚡ Performance Tips

Keep the bot fast and responsive! 🚀

### Do's ✅

- ✅ Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations
- ✅ Cache frequently accessed data
- ✅ Use connection pooling
- ✅ Monitor logs for slow operations
- ✅ Implement rate limiting (already built-in!)
- ✅ Use efficient data structures

### Don'ts ❌

- ❌ Don't use blocking operations
- ❌ Avoid unnecessary API calls
- ❌ Don't load large data sets into memory unnecessarily
- ❌ Avoid nested loops when possible
- ❌ Don't ignore memory leaks

```javascript
// ✅ Good - Non-blocking, efficient
async function processMessages(messages) {
  return Promise.all(messages.map(msg => processMessage(msg)));
}

// ❌ Bad - Blocking, inefficient
function processMessages(messages) {
  let results = [];
  for (let msg of messages) {
    results.push(processMessageSync(msg)); // Blocks on each iteration
  }
  return results;
}
```
