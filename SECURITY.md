## 🛡️ Security Features

### 🔒 DM-Only Mode (v2.0.0+)

**Privacy by Design:**
- Bot **only responds to Direct Messages** (DMs)
- All guild/channel messages are ignored (except hardcoded mention responses)
- Reduces attack surface and protects user privacy
- Prevents unauthorized access in compromised servers

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

**Built-in DDoS Protection:**
- **5 messages per minute** per user
- Prevents spam and abuse
- Automatic cleanup of expired limits
- Clear feedback to users when limits are hit

```javascript
// Rate limit implementation
const RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGES = 5;
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60000; // 1 minute
```

### 🔐 Environment Variable Security

**Sensitive Data Protection:**
- All secrets stored in `.env` file (never committed)
- `.env.example` template without real credentials
- Environment validation on startup
- Clear error messages without exposing sensitive data

**Protected Secrets:**
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Discord bot token
- `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` - n8n webhook endpoint
- API keys and credentials

### 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization

**Message Processing:**
- Discord.js handles input sanitization
- Message content is validated before processing
- Rate limiting prevents message flooding
- Command permissions are enforced

### 📊 Secure Logging

**Privacy-Preserving Logs:**
- **Never log sensitive data** (tokens, passwords, full webhook URLs)
- User IDs are logged (not personal information)
- Error stacks exclude sensitive context
- Logs are stored locally (not transmitted)

**What we DON'T log:**
- Discord tokens
- n8n webhook URLs (logged as `[REDACTED]`)
- User message content in production
- API keys or credentials

---

## 🔍 Security Practices

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

**Discord Integration:**
- Bot token is securely stored in environment variables
- Token has minimum required permissions
- Role-based access control for bot features
- Admin commands require elevated permissions

**n8n Integration:**
- Webhook URL is treated as a secret
- HTTPS-only communication (recommended)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents DoS
- Timeout protection (5 seconds default)

### 🔒 Dependency Security

**Supply-Chain Attack Mitigation:**

All package managers are configured with minimum release age to block compromised packages:

| Package Manager | Config File | Quarantine Period |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| npm | `.npmrc` | 7 days (`min-release-age=7`) |
| pnpm | `~/.config/pnpm/rc` | 7 days (`minimum-release-age=10080` min) |
| bun | `~/.bunfig.toml` | 7 days (`minimumReleaseAge=604800` sec) |
| uv (Python) | `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` | 7 days (`exclude-newer = "7 days"`) |

**Dependency Management Policy:**
- **Pin exact versions** in `package.json` (no `^` or `~` ranges)
- **Verify lockfile** (`package-lock.json`) is always committed
- **Audit new dependencies** before adding: check for known CVEs, evaluate maintainer track record, review source
- **Remove unused dependencies** — do not leave unused packages in the tree
- **Disable lifecycle scripts** (`ignore-scripts=true` in `.npmrc`) to block postinstall malware
- **Run `npm audit`** before every release and in CI/CD

**Keeping Dependencies Secure:**
- Node.js 22+ (latest LTS with security fixes)
- Discord.js 14.x (actively maintained)
- All dependencies regularly updated via Dependabot
- No known vulnerable dependencies (0 vulnerabilities as of 2026-04-02)

**Key Dependencies (pinned):**
- `discord.js`: 14.25.1
- `axios`: 1.14.0
- `undici`: 7.24.7
- `winston`: 3.19.0
- `dotenv`: 17.3.1

### 🛡️ Code Security

**Secure Coding Practices:**
- ✅ Async/await error handling (no unhandled rejections)
- ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
- ✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ No eval() or dangerous dynamic code execution
- ✅ TypeScript-style JSDoc annotations for type safety

### 🐳 Docker Security

**Container Security:**
- Multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Non-root user in production images
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- No unnecessary packages installed
- Trivy scanning in CI/CD pipeline
